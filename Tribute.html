                <h2>Indian Monastic</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. 
                    He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent, 
                    acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, 
                    where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in which he began his famous speech with the words: Sisters and brothers of America... before introducing Hinduism to Americans.
                    He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament".
